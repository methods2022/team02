# Team 02 README - Investigating COVID-19 Pandemic Temporal Research Trends

-This project analyzes the temporal frequency patterns of MeSH header data from COVID-19 related publications in NCBI's PubMed using Julia's EFetch pipeline. 

-This data is pulled into a series of Julia files that parse and prune the data for standardization purposes

-The processing files output MeSH descriptor counts indexed by Date of publication

-This data set is pulled into another Julia function that plots this data for analysis

-Development of these files is complete and can be run in Julia by a user

**- Describe very briefly but clearly what the project does.

    State if it is out-of-the-box user-friendly, so it’s clear to the user.
    List its most useful/innovative/noteworthy features.
    State its goals/what problem(s) it solves.
    Note and briefly describe any key concepts (technical, philosophical, or both) important to the user’s understanding.
    Link to any supplementary blog posts or project main pages.
    Note its development status.
    Include badges.
    If possible, include screenshots and demo videos.**

Core Technical Concepts/Inspiration

-The purpose for these functions is to build graphics and collect learnings from temporal publication trends the current COVID-19 pandemic.

-These learnings are intended to provide best practices or insight into strategizing for future pandemics.

-WE SHOULD INCLUDE REQUIRED PACKAGES HERE

-ADD SEQUENCE OF FILES TO RUN TO PULL, PROCESS, AND VISUALIZE DATA

-INCLUDE API ERROR WORK AROUNDS

**- Why does it exist?

    Frame your project for the potential user.
    Compare/contrast your project with other, similar projects so the user knows how it is different from those projects.
    Highlight the technical concepts that your project demonstrates or supports. Keep it very brief.
    Keep it useful.**
